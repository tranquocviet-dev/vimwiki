# are we a victim of the past or are we prisoners of the future 

a question i had rigorously over the years is "what am i doing this for?". so often i feel i am chained by the actions of my past, while it has already been so far gone. after reading the book [bk001](bk001) i have come to the realization that the past has nothing on me and i dont need to follow what is set for me. instead my current problem comes from the fact that i have ambitions way beyond my capabilities, and as such i do not have any control of the outcome of my projects
