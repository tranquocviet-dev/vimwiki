# 2026-01-13-the-lack-of-trust-i-have-with-corporations

i dont think its just me. i dont even think its just _some_
the more i think about it, the more i realize that corporations are just trying to gain my trust for their own sake
to them life is just money talks and greed is a virtue
i wont be controlled by their thinkings. i may work for them in the future, but i wont yield to their thinkings
