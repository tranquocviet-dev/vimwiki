# i3 is amazing

the modern landscape of tech has created a trend that defines looks: lots of effects, "clean"
the effect is that nowadays people focus on visuals more than technicality
instead i find i3's stupidly simple design very effective
its a use-first window manager that has a complete toolkit on startup and doesnt need any help to being useful
it has surprisingly many features that make the windows managing process a lot more engaging than others
and is has a charm unmatched by its peers
