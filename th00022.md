# ego is nice actually
stagnation is more common than you think, it comes from a lack of trying to improve
what most athletes wont tell you is that ego is important, as it is the catalyst to more effort organically
they also wont tell you that the motivation on others is not sustainable in high levels of competition
it is you who must muster up the need to improve, to win, to get better
