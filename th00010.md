as stated in [th00004](th00004.md) i wont use **good** or **better**
the thing that makes a website convenient is accessibility
is the amount of links one can click on in a single screen that leads to meaningful places
it doesnt matter the size of these links, the sectioning or all that
if one can get to where they want in, say 2 clicks, you have succeeded
because it doesnt matter how the site's content is displayed
after some time of using users will understand where the things they are looking for are
so its just a matter of **how long does it take for them to get to where they want**
