# what it means to get a setup right
i think it is more a matter of understanding the purpose of your setup than making it look good
some setup looks bad but is very functional, like you cant switch away from it
others try to look nice but fails when the condition is infavourable 
ill probably glaze solarized too much at this point but it really is just a matter of need
the best setup is the one you always come back to
