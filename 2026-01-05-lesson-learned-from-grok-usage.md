what i find most fascinating is the lack of a real limit to the things people can try
sure the AI itself is flawed in ways that really limits the interractions it **can** do
but people **can** try. and they **will** try
thus i believe that the tool isnt making our critical thinking worse
its actually making us approach the problem in a different way
afterall AI are just tools
humans are the ones that use them
