# the pursuit of simplicity
i heard a really great quote from [tsoding](tsoding) today: once you are more experienced you will eventually want to get away from all the unessesary stuff and focus on whats actually important.
i couldnt agree more, as simplicity allows us to find what actually matters, and therefore we can grow to remove those non-mandatory parts
