# people are simple and complex at the same time

there is no need to change to "become" someone else. i know that. but sometimes its funny just how similar we all feel towards others. perhaps we are enchanced by them, perhaps its our instinct to do the same thing as others. either way we are responsible for the changes that occurs to us. just because we become like someone else doesnt mean it is their fault so.
