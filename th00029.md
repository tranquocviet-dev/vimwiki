# to change is to accept
it isnt exactly clear to some why their life has to change in ways they didnt anticipate. maybe they thought they didnt need changes, and that they are perfect just the way they are. but the reality is that we as humans has a drive to continuosly improve, and get better, not for anyone else but ourselves. to that, i say, just accept what your life has to offer, and live a life not bound by the past
