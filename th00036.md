# pondering the meaning of life 

what is the meaning of life? is it perhaps what i can do to contribute to this world? is it how much i value the world and its people? is it happiness? is it sadness?
no, perhaps it is what i feel. what **i feel**, not others. perhaps i have looked at the wrong angle. perhaps life is simple and i dont need to care about its meaning.
