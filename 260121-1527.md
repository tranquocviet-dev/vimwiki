# the real reason why we care
there is a phenomenon that if you care for something enough you will eventually grow to understand its pain or damage
this applies to watches, people, etc
so why do we care? might as well care only for yourseves right?
theres a rule that [communication is the cornerstone of evolution](260121-1532), and by extension, so is relationships
it can be simple as just co worker relationship or it can be more intimate as a lovers relationship
however it is it remains as the cornerstone of our lives
and by extension, we grow to care and to maintain such relationships
