# vs00106
[[zk-org/zk-nvim]] as a base plugin
uses zettelkasten
3 types of note
- one for daily notes and thoughts
- one for writing from sources
- one for storing concepts
uses folders for file storing

had much success early on due to being simple
problem arose when the folder structure caused seperation
i couldnt understand what the "daily" notes was for
this system was not sustainable, so i find another
created [[vs00107.md]]

[[vs001.md]]
