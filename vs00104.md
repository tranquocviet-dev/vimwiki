# vs00104
i just went straight ahead into creating a folder of info
used the best tool that google suggested (obsidian)
it worked, but had many problems
- i didnt have any structure knowledge
- too reliant on folders which is bothersome
- wrote big files as a whole which made writing take long
- im more familiar with neovim than obsidian
thus i nailed down [[vs00105.md]]

[[vs001.md]]
