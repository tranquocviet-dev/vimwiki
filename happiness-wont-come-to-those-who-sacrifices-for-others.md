# happiness wont come to those who sacrifices for others
it is often said that those that help others will get their flowers eventually
and while this is true it doesnt concern those who make sacrifices for people
because sacrificing means actively ignoring ones happiness in favour of others
i dont care if it is noble the truth is that you are ignoring yourself
and that isnt happiness
