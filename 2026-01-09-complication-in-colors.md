i really like solarized, its one of my favourite colorschemes of all time
but sometimes it is too hard on the eye
i cant really describe it, like for some reason the version of solarized im on is bugged and displays far too bright colors for my liking
im trying to find a fix to it
okay so the fix is just to make colorscheme not base16 lol
are they really that important? maybe not
