# working-for-the-money-is-standard
people mostly expect working is for the sake of completing tasks, helping, etc
which is why working for the money should also be respected
it means one is willing to sacrifice comfort for their own goals
rather than seeing it as selfish i see it as necessary for one's development
only once one has the means to help themselves should they wield the means to help others
