# choose your color to live by

everyone can represent colors, happiness, sadness, projecting themselves and being more than just a perspective on the person. peoples color can change, as per [to live is to change](th00028.md), and as such, there is no need to completely stick with one color forever. you just have to pick one for the time youre currently picking.
