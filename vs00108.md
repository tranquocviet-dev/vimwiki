uses templates for everything, reducing writing time
has almost every single thing i want
- a clear direction
- a working, simple system
- the usage of files are clear cut
- the style is consistent
- emphasis on linking

i wrote with this for a long time
but i noticed some issues with this approach
- i didnt start with his templates rather his system and
developed my own
- forcing me to make my own templates all the time
- i was having to input and insert tags everywhere
- relied too much on obsidian to insert templates
- thus, relied too much on templates
- this isnt a file-first approach, rather format-first
- sometimes take too long to write
multiple small problems rather than big issues
meant that this isnt sustainable
