the first thing many people think about when they see better people is that they want to overcome them, or in my case, be them. this has a downside in that i cant really reach out of the box in terms of what i want myself to be. now that i have understood myself more, the thought of inferiority is irrelevant now, as i am not comparing myself to that person but rather the image of a perfect person. i must grow, and so that image must die.
