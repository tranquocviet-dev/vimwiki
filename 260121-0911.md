# system development
databases have primary key, basically a unique id generated to distinguish the object
if transferred to annother table it becomes foreign key
**views** are many tables combined
**sequence** are data generators for tables, not nessesarily incrementally, and can be configured
**index** are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly
**datatypes** self explanitory
**database stored procedure** is a prepareds sql code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again
**trigger** are automatically executed on events

## requirements
functional: it must be available
non-functional: it would be *really* nice if it can be available

## principles
requires team effort
careful planning

## system failure
comes from 
- lack of understandind requirements
- lack of user input
- changing requirements and specifications
