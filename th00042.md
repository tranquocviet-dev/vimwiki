- why i tried emacs
---

emacs is flawed, as per the words of [tsoding](tsoding), it is very janky, it is very hacky.
but one very cool thing about emacs is that the modes (as it is called) in emacs are intergrated very nicely. only after trying emacs i understood the importance of having movement keybinds in the file insert mode. it feels awesome not having to leave that most important mode for something esle.
to me, that alone is worth the hassle of 3 hours reading emacs tutorial.
