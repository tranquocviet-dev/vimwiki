# a lack of evidence
i have always disliked
- taking notes
- writing journals
- taking pictures
it creates many problems in my life
i dont have any evidence of existance
- be it physical or digital
- leads to me feeling left out
i have trouble learning deeply
- i dont have a reference to look for info
something had to change
