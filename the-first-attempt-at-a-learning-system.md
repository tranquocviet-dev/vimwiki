# my first real attempt at a learning system
i just went straight ahead into creating a folder of info
used the best tool that google suggested (obsidian)
it worked, but had many problems
* i didnt have any structure knowledge
* too reliant on folders which is bothersome
* wrote big files as a whole which made writing take long
* im more familiar with neovim than obsidian
thus i nailed down [my-first-system-requirements](my-first-system-requirements)
