the beginning of all
the system is once again, reliable and simple
more simple than ever
- simply markdown files with no extras
- has an index page and map of contents for navigation
- structure emphasize understanding the usage
if i want to write about a new thing i can create a empty
map of contents and start writing immediately

this approach finally put emphasis on files rather than
format which makes it changable
even as i wrote the script of this video i changed the
format multiple times, but the content stays in a way
i can understand all the same
