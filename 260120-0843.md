# i like the word placebo 
its no secret that the world of science and technology is upon us, and there are fancier and fancier products around us 
in fact i already made a note regarding this phenomenon, [i dont like capital letters](th00003) in there i talked briefly about fancy stuff
but the real kicker is how people dont realize they are being placebo fed, as most of the fancy benefits are just minor upgrades
its the mindset shift that has made them more valuable to people.
and i think thats pretty cool.
