# vs00109
had to use as little folders to store info as possible
i have to understand what each type of note was used for
learned from the first experiment that i want to link note
no tags, no property edits
no templates, reduce rigidness
the form has to be simple enough to reproduce by hand
- quickly
- cleanly
- still allow for structural allocation

inspired by [[jonmsterling.com]], kepano's vast formats
i went back to a familiar place in... vim?
