  - wait

sometimes the best thing we can do is to wait stuff out. it isnt clear right away how and why we are doing the things we are currently, but everything leads somewhere. as per [the courage to be disliked](bk001), we are not bound by the path ahead nor the past behind, but we can learn from them and adjust ourselves accordingly.
